## Session Summary
Learn how to take over our integrations and make them do what you want. 
Out of the box our integrations with products like Maya, Nuke, Houdini, and 
Photoshop allow for basic software launching and file sharing, but their true 
power is unleashed once you take control of the configuration and provide a custom 
directory structure and hooks to automate more of the data flow in your studio.
